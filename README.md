Hello, I'm Jack!

## About Me

- Big 4 management consultant: specialising in using data science to deliver actionable intelligence.
- Recent Physics (MPhys) graduate from the University of Warwick - you can find my dissertation and it's supporting codes [here](https://github.com/1602077/MPHYS_BacterialChemotaxis "Bacterial Chemotaxis of Bacillus subtilis under Antibiotic Challenge"). 
- Music lover and massive collector of vinyl - check out my [webscraper](https://github.com/1602077/vinyl_pricechecker), which I built using bs4 which automates the price check of my wishlist record's via bash.

### What I'm Working on Now...

- [Stanford's CS231N - Convolution Neural Networks for Vision Recognition](https://cs231n.github.io) - Please find my assignment solutions [here](https://github.com/1602077/stanford_cs231n)! I am currently working on translating my Generative Adverisal Network (GAN) implimentation from PyTorch to Tensorflow.

##### Currently Reading... 
Douglas R. Hofstadter - Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid


I am incredibly passionate about music and would like to gain experience in the application of strategic data science intiatives to the music industry. Music has had such a massive impact on my mental well being that I would love the opportunity to affect meaningful change through applying my skills as a data scientist
