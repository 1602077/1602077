Hello, I'm Jack!
================

I am recent MPhys physics graduate - you can find my disseretation and it's supporting codes [here](https://github.com/1602077/MPHYS_BacterialChemotaxis "Bacterial Chemotaxis of Bacillus subtilis under Antibiotic Challenge"). 


I am incredibly passionate about music and would like to gain experience in the application of strategic data science intiatives to the music industry. Music has had such a massive impact on my mental well being that I would love the opportunity to affect meaningful change through applying my skills as a data scientist
