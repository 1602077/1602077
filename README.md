Hello, I'm Jack!
================

## About Me

- I currently work as a management consultant for one of the Big 4, specialising in using data science to deliver actionable intelligence for their clients.
- I am recent Physics (MPhys) graduate from the University of Warwick - you can find my dissertation and it's supporting codes [here](https://github.com/1602077/MPHYS_BacterialChemotaxis "Bacterial Chemotaxis of Bacillus subtilis under Antibiotic Challenge"). 
- I love music and am I massive collector of vinyl - check out my [webscraper](https://github.com/1602077/vinyl_pricechecker), which I built using bs4 which automates the price check of my wishlist record's via bash.


I am incredibly passionate about music and would like to gain experience in the application of strategic data science intiatives to the music industry. Music has had such a massive impact on my mental well being that I would love the opportunity to affect meaningful change through applying my skills as a data scientist
